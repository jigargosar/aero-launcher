    <h2>Look Up in Dictionary</h2>

	<p>Select the Dictionary application in LaunchBar and press the space bar to enter a search term that shall be looked up in Dictionary.</p>

	<a name="text-clips"></a>
    <h2>Text Clips</h2>

	<p>A text document whose filename ends with a special <tt>.clip.txt</tt> or <tt>.clip.rtf</tt> filename extension is treated as a Text Clip File. Opening such a file via LaunchBar inserts the file’s contents in the frontmost application.</p>

	<a name="terminal"></a>
    <h2>Terminal Interaction</h2>

	<p>LaunchBar provides a number of commands to interact with Terminal or iTerm.</p>

	<div class="small box">
		If you prefer to use iTerm instead of Terminal, select the “Preferred Terminal Application” in the <a href="x-launchbar:pref-pane?identifier=actions.options">Actions pane</a> of LaunchBar Preferences accordingly.
	</div>

	<h3>Open Terminal Here</h3>

	<p>Select a folder in LaunchBar and choose File &gt; Open Terminal Here or press Command-T to open a new Terminal window with the current working directory set to that folder.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, you can send a selected folder to Terminal by pressing Tab and selecting Terminal.</p>

	<h3>Run Terminal Command With…</h3>

	<p>Choose File &gt; Run Terminal Command With… or press Command-Shift-T to enter a Unix command that shall be executed with the currently selected file or folder as an argument.</p>

	<p class="indent"><tt>open -a LaunchBar .</tt></p>

	<p>to select the current working directory of your shell in LaunchBar.</p>

	<a name="send-to-launchbar"></a>
    <h2>Send to LaunchBar</h2>

	<p>The “Send to LaunchBar” command is accessible from the Services menu of other applications, allowing you to send a file or a text that is currently selected in that application to LaunchBar.</p>

	<p>You can e.g. select one or more files in Finder, or select some text in TextEdit or Safari, then press <span class="nobr">Command-Shift-F1</span> to send this selection to LaunchBar.</p>

	<div class="small box" title="Note">
		You may also use <a href="InstantSend.html">Instant Send</a> for that purpose, which has the same effect of sending the current selection to LaunchBar.
