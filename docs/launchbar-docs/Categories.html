	<h1>Categories</h1>

	<div class="preface">
		The Categories indexing rule automatically groups similar items. All items of the same kind are collected in a single category, allowing you to <a href="Subsearch.html">sub-search</a> this category for a specific item.
	</div>

	<p>If you are searching for an item of a particular kind, you can use categories to restrict the search-scope to items of that kind. Just select the corresponding category and press Space to search within this category only.</p>

	<div class="small box">
		Note that the Categories indexing rule performs no indexing on its own. It just provides another perspective on the items that are already indexed.
	</div>

	<div style="margin-top:32px"></div>

	<div class="small white box">
		<h3>Example 1</h3>

		<p>Let’s say you have created a bookmark folder in Safari named “News” and you wish to select this folder in LaunchBar in order to retrieve one of the contained bookmarks. Type e.g. <kbd>BF</kbd> to select the “Bookmark Folders” category, which contains all of your bookmark folders. Now press the space bar to sub-search this category for the “News” folder. Then press the space bar again to show all the bookmarks in this folder.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="small white box">
		<h3>Example 2</h3>

		<p>Say you are looking for a particular image. Instead of searching the whole index you can restrict the search result to image files only by sub-searching the “Image Files” category.</p>

		<p>If you know the exact type of the searched image file, you can restrict the search even further. You may e.g. type <kbd>PSIM</kbd> to select the “Adobe Photoshop Images” category, and search for Photoshop documents only.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="small white box">
		<h3>Example 3</h3>

		<p>If you wish to play a particular album from your iTunes Library, select the Albums category, press Space and type an abbreviation for the album’s name.</p>

		<p>Or even faster, select and sub-search the Albums category with a single keystroke using <a href="InstantSend.html">Instant Send</a>.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Company, Department and Job Title categories</h2>

	<p>The “Company”, “Department” and “Job Title” categories allow you to quickly retrieve groups of similar contacts.</p>

	<p>LaunchBar automatically groups people working for the same company, within in the same department or people with the same profession. These categories are directly accessible via abbreviation search.</p>

	<p>You need a plumber? Just enter <kbd>PLUM</kbd> to select the <em>Plumbers</em> category, then hit the right arrow key to display a list of all plumbers available from your contacts.</p>

	<p>You may also search for a particular company by sub-searching the <em>Companies</em> category, then press right arrow to retrieve all people working for that company.</p>
